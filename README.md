**Technologies that I used**

This website is built using a combination of modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and visually appealing design.

1. **HTML5**: The structure of the website is created using semantic HTML5 elements, providing a clear and accessible layout.

2. **CSS3**:

- **Flexbox**: Used in the profile section to create a flexible and efficient layout. Flexbox allows for easy alignment and distribution of space among items in a container, making it ideal for responsive design.
- **CSS Grid**: Implemented in the gallery section with the auto-fit property. CSS Grid provides a powerful layout system that allows images to be organized neatly in a grid, automatically adjusting to different screen sizes.
- **Media Queries**: Employed to create an adaptive design that ensures the website looks great and functions well on various devices and screen sizes. Media queries allow for specific CSS rules to be applied based on the characteristics of the device, such as its width.

3. **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices, from desktops to smartphones. This is achieved through the use of Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries.

4. **SVG and Images**: Used for icons and high-quality gallery images.

This combination of technologies ensures that the website is both functional and visually appealing, providing a great user experience on all devices.
